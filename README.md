## Set up (Web App)

At first, _install_ all dependencies for the server:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, _install_ all dependencies for the react app and _build_ it:

```bash
cd client
yarn
react-scripts build # build React app
cd ..
```

**Important!** Make sure you fill the [config file](.env)!

And run the app:

```bash
yarn dev
```
